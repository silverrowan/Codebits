### Why is (Aerobic) exercise important to learning?
- BDNF is one of the key neuroplacticity chemicals. Aerobic exercise seems to directly increase its expression!
- shown to produce long-term changes to your hipocampal volume (key part involved in memory) as well as long term improvements in your memory and a higher baseline level of BDNF.
- non-aerobic exercises do not do as much (nearly) as aerobic, but it does do a little bit.
