### How does Dopamine improve learning?
- dopamine *directly* reduces the threshold that you need to reach for neuroplastic change to occur!
- directly increases the gene expression of neuroplasticity chemicals
- it feels good you're more likely to do it again. Positive feedback cycle. Creates motivation.
