Route memorization not great process for learning - basically brute forcing it.

((from diff video - thinking about how to ORGANIZE information helps way more with learning, as does TESTING self on the material soon after reading))

Video:
- certain principles are necessary for max effectiveness learning:
- memory is a symptom, (your  processes may lead to good or poor memory)
    - cognitive processes much more important than physical - writing/reading looks like doesn't matter so much, but what THOUGHTS you have about this information, what do you do with it.
        - these determine *depth of learning*
    - **integrative processes** ("higher order" learning) are vastly more effective than isolated
        - looking for patterns, how it connects, at the big picture, looking for relevance and ways to make it relevant.
        - those thoughts, even if you don't get to a clear answer, the thinking itself builds a stronger, deeper memory and deepens your understanding
        - involves more effort
            - the degree of effort that learning takes is actually a decent proxy for how well you're learning the information
            - Effective, active learning, takes more metal effort--integrative thinking 'behind the scenes' takes a lot more.
            - one problem is people feel the effort and think it means they aren't learning, or that its 'too hard' and less effective. 
    - These methods more closely mirror the 'survival' type of thinking that brain is much better adapted to do. 
- Teaching someone else works so well because:
    -  it takes more effort & engagement to teach someone
    - it uses a different process
    - recall what your learn
    - organize your thoughts
    - Try to find a logical way to present and explain
        - (teach to a 10 yrs old? now you have to *simplify it* perspective shift? Simplifying is actually difficult)
        - Making something simple, accurate, and comprehensive is CHALLENGING
-  **Thinking about the process(es**)
    - and **varying** them!
- Doing lots of integrative thinking
- It should be taking **reasonable effort and be mentally engaging**.
 - Practice the *patterns* of thinking!

Active Learning Methods

## Learning Styles (are bull)
> from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNu-pEHvZd4
- incredibly studied, basically not a real thing.
- 2 decades of research showing that people do not have a 'learning style'
    - people do have learning *preferences*, and learning *habits*
        - thinking you have one 'learning style' actually leads to inflexibility and pigeon-holing. It gets in the way.
        - Your brain is incredibly capable of a lot. Of learning and adapting. 
        - most people are able to learn effectively in any style or modality **IF**
            - taught how to, and given time to practice and turn it into a habit.
            - basically everyone will *benefit* from learning in more than one style or modality. Makes you more adaptable, powerful learning.
        - most people are 'visual learners' -- because the human brain is extremely visually oriented and great at processing visual information.
    - what works for one person, doesn't necessarily work for someone else.
        - but its because of those *habits* that it may be more or less effective.
        - Unique individualization, variation, and personalization of learning is important, but its really the end stage of becoming an efficient leaner.
    - Certain Principles are pretty much universal
    - Learning is not fixed
        - it is about training processes and new habits
        - what are my current learning habits and preferences
            - when do they work for me, when do they not
            - how to I change and adapt them so that they work for me better & more often
## Spacing / Spaced Repetition / Space Retrieval
- one of if not the most well studied and valuable methods of learning
- "ebbing house forgetting curve" (reciprocal curve) or '*knowledge decay*'
    - active recall and spacing is a very effective way of re-enforcing knowledge
        - cue cards: anki active recall/spaced retrieval
- ![[Pasted image 20251108183435.png]]
Because its got testing built in, it invokes the active recall effect - so its effective vs passive learning.
One of a very small number of techniques that are very easy to use: perceived low effort.
Generally good learning review spacing is review everything you learned after each of:
    - 1 day
    - 1 week
    - 1 month
        -these are "ish" timelines.  
    - making sure the retrieval strategy hits all the key points is FAR more important than the exact timing.

### When does spacing not work so well?
- limitations
    - flash card overwhelm
        - unsustainable
    - repetition
    - time to make it, time to review. 
        - most of us need around 3-7 times reviewing for an adequate level of retention. Generally takes WEEKS to get where you want to.
        - for each new piece of information, you're committing to 3-7x repetition (in addition to making the cad)
            - learning debt.
            - do something that prepares you for future learning, but its future self that has to spend the time to remember it.
                - eg. writing notes.
    - doesn't address Mastery
        - and now spending all this extra time on memorization repetition. 
        - learning isolated factoids
        - Mastering limited

## But we want a high level retention *and* mastery
- Any technique that is about retrieval (recalling) information from memory and using that tends to be easier to learn properly/more "bang for the buck"
    - as opposed to encoding, which is taking new information into memory for the first time. 
- Retrieval skills can be learned correctly very quickly. (easier learning curve)
- They are effective techniques that produces noticeable short-term changes to your retention and mastery. Provides an 'immediate improvement'
- The difficulty to gain really good, high quality encoding skills is much higher. 
    - It is incredibly powerful, and worthwhile to pursue, but for most people it takes time. It is a much more complicated process.

Retrieval strategies that are active, help form a good schema and therefore help with high retention and high mastery.
- many that can work
    - should still use spacing!
        - Generally good learning review spacing is review everything you learned after each of:
            - 1 day
            - 1 week
            - 1 month
                -these are "ish" timelines.  
            - making sure the retrieval strategy hits all the key points is FAR more important than the exact timing.
### criteria
- helping us create a schema (testing in a relatively integrated way)
- active recall (retrieving knowledge from your memory)
    - 3 commonly talked about forms:
        - free recall - without any kind of prompt
            - most effective.
            - benefit of free recall over cued is that it allows you to use more elaborate types of knowledge. Able to use your knowledge in a more integrated way, because the scope of it is much greater.
            - common example of this is teaching the concept to a 10-yr-old
                - have to build the structure, decide whats important, create big picture, order, etc. simplify without loosing important information, etc.
            - brain dump (tell me everything you know about this topic)
                - can be very effective, but doesn't force us to evaluate that knowledge to a deeper extent. Can be done in a very isolated manner.
            - for coding, should be trying to code aps! because it builds all three types of knowledge, whereas explaining how to to someone else will have gaps.
        - cued recall - when there's a prompt
            - much more effective than recognition, *but* there is a risk when you expose yourself to the que too much, that you are no longer retrieving the knowledge in a contextually appropriate way, and just in isolation.
            - Always be switching up those cues!
        - recognition - just recognizing it  - not actually very useful
            - but also dangerously common
            - our ability to recognize something is *extreemely* high compared to our ability to recall and generate that information
- practice how you play
    - procedural knowledge - how
    - declarative knowledge - what --->
    - conditional knowledge - when and why
### Evaluate: is it a good technique?
#### Practice Exams:
- does it help create an integrated schema of knowledge: depends on the questions being asked.
    - oh theres an idea - get ai to generate questions that are integrative, testing you at a higher level!
        - eg prompt: Create questions for me, along the spectrum of Bloom's taxonomy levels 2 to 5
- does it encourage active recall, specifically free or diverse cued recall: again, it depends.
- does it help you to practice how you play: are they geared in such a way that they're similar to how you're actually going to use that knowledge (eg. in the exam vs for work)
#### Re-read & re-write summarize notes
- does it help create an integrated schema of knowledge: not much.
    - the summarization aspect helps to think about it at a big picture level a little bit more, but doesnt really bring in any new pattersn/links/etc. Still relatively isolated.
        - now, completely re-organizing & synthesizing may do this.
- does it encourage active recall, specifically free or diverse cued recall: probably not - are you making summary notes based on your memory, or just working from your existing notes.
- does it help you to practice how you play: Not really.
## Encoding Criteria
- the research on what is and is not effective in encoding is extremely complicated.
- This is a summary of the principles that we know if your trying to do this with your encoding its going to be helpful
    - most unifying principle: always relate information to the big picture
        - ask yourself: what is the purpose of learning this
            - where does this fit in relation to everything else that I'm learning, in relation to the big picture
    - Try to simplify what you learn (these two work together)
        - at the time your learning this, aim to simplify it to where you can simply see where it fits into a simplified big picture.
        - look for simpler concepts, ideas. Build the big picture in the simplest way, the fastest way first.
        - This increases the overall network, the overall schema
        - these two principles create a Scaffolding
            - seeing that this information fits somewhere, that its connected to something else helps convince the brain that its relevant. influences other pieces of information
                - need to deliberately look for those connections
    - ONCE we have a simple understanding we can
    -  learn in layers
        - Add on another layer of detail on the scaffolding and see how that fits into the big picture. once understand that, add another layer....
        - Something like mind maps are a great tool for doing this, but they are an absolutely useless tool if you're not using them in this way.
- The majority of what produces the benefit of proper encoding is actually just how you think.
    - you can use an exteemely rudimentary technique, like just reading a book, 
        - if you think in this way while doing the reading you will have much much higher quality knowledge than someone who is just reading passively
        - this is why you can't just copy successful students
            - a lot of successful students are doing this encoding process at a much higher level because of their existing habits of learning
            - deep processing at a high level doesnt neccessarily need fancy teqniques because  your brain is already integrating the knowlege at that levbel
                - course, if you have deep processing and then you use a technique that facillates the encoding and your natural processes.
- How long does it take (if just starting this journey) to be able to do all this
    - if you want to master it, it will take sever years w constant diligent effort
    - but, dont need to master it.
        - the idea of training learning systematically is extreemely novel.
        - what seems to make the biggest difference in pple who can train themselves quickly.
            - if you're not actively trying to retrain your learning/thinking then you may never really see a noticiable improiovement
            - most pple never really learn how to remember more of what they learn because they're not in that journey long enough.
            - assuming you *are* we normally see after ~ the first month (3-5wks) there are noticible changes in your remember and depth of mastery, or at least understand what is holding you back.
                - biggest common issue:
                - getting to a pt where you have increased your learning efficiency and retention and mastery about 30-50% more than before in 30-50% less time. within the first 1-3 months
                - biggest thing that makes a difference on how quickly someone improves is *how willing they are to make mistakes*
                    - the more willing to make mistakes the faster learning (like 10-20x faster)
                    - so now deliberately teaching frameworks for how to change that mindset because an integral part of the learning program.
                    - how to turn mistakes into learning so therefore have the confidence to make the mistake and learn from them.

## Learning Effectively
How to do active learning properly?

Just ask yourself these 4 questions:
    Am I trying to make new information simpler to understand? (encoding)
    Am I grouping the information together? (encoding)
    Am I thinking about how what I’m learning relates to the big picture? (encoding)
    Am I recalling things I’ve learned from memory? (recal)

If the answer to any of these questions is no, try to make it a yes.
It’s not always easy but it gets easier every week as you get better at it.
Once you answer yes at least 80% of the time you spend learning, your memory and even ENJOYMENT of learning will skyrocket.
