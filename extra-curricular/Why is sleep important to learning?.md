## Why is sleep important to learning?
- While sleeping your brain does a thing called "*sleep-dependent memory consolidation*" It takes what you've learned and moves it to a more usable, more retrievable pathway/part of the brain.
- and learning changes are still being re-enforced during your sleep. your brain goes into a 'maintenance mode' during which it replays certain neural pathways activated during the day and strengthen them, and prunes the ones that aren't needed. 
- Without enough sleep:
    - concentration, focus, thinking capacity, executive capacity, and the brains ability to adapt/change/grow all decrease!
