## Effective Learning Checklist
- Certain **conditions need to be met to promote optimal** learning, neuroplasticity, effectiveness, speed, and sustained change.

- ~ **Intention**
    - clear and purposeful in *how* we are thinking & learning so we re-enforce the more beneficial pathways for learning.
    - There is no one 'optimal' learning method, per say - its about understanding *how* the technique is *meant to make you think*
    - **integrative processes** ("higher order" learning) are vastly more effective than isolated
        - looking for patterns, how it connects, at the big picture, looking for relevance and ways to make it relevant.
        - those thoughts, even if you don't get to a clear answer, the thinking itself builds a stronger, deeper memory and deepens your understanding
- ~ **Intensity**
    - Learning happens best when it is *challenging, but not **too** challenging*
        - "Zone of proximal development" or "goldilocks zone" is *just* outside your current comfort zone and ability
    - Should calibrate the intensity to that it's *always* challenging.
        - Get good enough (**not** "perfect") before moving to a more difficult level, so you stay challenged.
        - your own sense of mental  effort and what is challenging is the only way to tell if the intensity is enough for you.
- ~ **Variety**
    - The most effective way is to do *slightly different* challenging things (over and over again).
    - interleaving is super helpful - mixing multiple topics while studying.
        - Increases variety AND another way of looking for patterns/connections/etc (that integrative part!)
    - Autopilot actually causes plasticity to drop.
    - Unpredictability (and occasional errors!) help calibrate your brain to determine which pathways are better and worse. 
- ~ **Frequency**
    - Frequent practice of intentional/intense/challenging/varied learning is needed! Without regular use of the skill, your brain will start pruning back pathways.
    - This is not "thinking" about challenging yourself, but immersing yourself in the practice of challenging yourself.
- ~ **Duration**
        - Research is very unclear on how long this is
        - being haphazard with your practice will draw out learning dramatically, *if* you even hit the threshold long enough to trigger lasting change. 
        - In optimal practice, differences can be seen in as little as 4-6 weeks!
        - Normally its months->years--but its not binary: every week/month there's incremental improvements.
- ~ **3 foundational factors** that need to be locked in or the effect of the prev 5 will be significantly reduced.
    - ~ **EMOTION!**
        - when an experience is more emotional it leaves a bigger, more lasting effect on the brain. Try to make a level of dopamine!
         - When we learn more in line with how our brains want to learn, it will generally produce dopamine.

    - ~ **SLEEP**
        - when it comes to learning and memory and the brain, sleep is *incredibly, incredibly important*
        - **Don't sacrifice sleep** - its unhealthy and it **GETS IN THE WAY** of learning.
        - learning changes are still being re-enforced during your sleep.

    - ~ **EXERCISE**
        - specifically ***aerobic*** exercise.
        - Any level of aerobic exercise has an effect.
        - Sweet spot though, is *roughly* **3-5x per week**, roughly **30-45min** per session, at around a **"6 out of 10" intensity** -_- well that last bit is vauge._
            - 6/10 = pretty moderate, vigorous level of activity
        - 15-20min moderate exercise have proven improvement in learning over then next few hours.
