//Objects are a non-primative datatype in JS. 
    //Used to store keyed collections of data/complex enties
    //objects (can) contain lists of *properties* - or a key: value pair.
        //Key is a string, value can be anything


//==========CREATE OBJECT==========
//=================================        
//two syntax forms to create a new object: "object constructor" and "object literal"
    //OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR syntax
        let newObject1 = new Object();
    //OBJECT LITERAL syntax
        let newObject2 = {}; 

    //can also immediately input properties when creating object 
    //     -- DOES THIS WORK W CONSTRUCTOR? I ASSUME IT DOES BUT CHECK
        let userExample = { //the object 
            name: "John",   //property 1: key = name, value = "John"
            age: 30         //property 2: key = age, value = 30
            "likes birds": true, //MULTIWORD property names (keys) must be quoted
        };
                        //NOTE: *comma* after property, not usual semicolon UNTIL object is closed.
                        //last property ending in a comma (trailing, or hanging comma) makes
                        //      altering--add/remove/move properties easier b/c all are alike


//==========READ, ADD, & DELETE PROPERTIES==========
//==================================================
//again, two syntax forms! Dot notation and square bracket notation
    //DOT NOTATION eg.
        alert( userExample.name);   //returns John
        alert( userExample.age);    //returns 30
        userExample.isAdmin = true;     //adds property "isAdmin"
        delete userExample.age;         //removes property "age"

    //SQUARE BRACKET NOTATION eg.
        userExample["likes birds"] = true; //setting property
        alert(userExample["likes birds"]); //getting property; value = true
        delete userExample["likes birds"]; //delete property


//==========DOT vs [] NOTATION USE LIMITS==========
//=================================================    
    //Multiword property names DONT WORK with Dot access! Use Square bracket notation with quotes
        //eg
        let userExample = {};
        userExample["likes birds"] = true; //setting property

    //[] notation can be used to access values of *variable* property names, eg:
        let key = "likes birds";
        user[key] = true;
        //same as user["likes birds"] = true; 
        //kinda useless like this, but used like below....

        let user = { name: "john", age: 30,};
        let key = prompt("what do you want to know about the user?", "name");
            //access by variable
            alert( user[key] ); // John, if entered "name"
            //dot notation CANNOT be used the same way!
            alert(user.key) //returns undefined

//==========COMPUTED PROPERTIES==========
//======================================== 
    // using [] in an obj literal when creating an object.
        //eg
        let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy", "apple");
        let bag = {
            [fruit]:5 //the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit--in this case, apple
        };
        alert( bag.apple ); //5 if fruit = apple

        //essentially the same as (but better looking?):
            let fruit = prompt("which fruit to buy", "apple");
            let bag = {};
            //take property name from fruit variable
            bag[fruit] = 5;

    //more complex expressions can also be used in []
        let fruit = 'apple';
        let bag = {
            [fruit + 'Computers']: 5 //becomes bag.appleComputers = 5
        };

//==========PROPERTY VALUE SHORTHAND==========
//============================================ 
//CONFUSED - what is going on here, how is it clear that the variable is the value and not the name?
        //using existing variable as value for property names is v common so has a shorthand
        //eg
            function makeUser(name, age) {
                return {
                    name: name,
                    age: age,
                    //etc
                };
            }

            let user = makeUser("John", 30);
            alert(user.name); //returns John

        //can also be written as:
            function makeUser(name, age) {
                return {
                    name,   //same as name: name
                    age,    //same as age: age
                }
            }
        //can use a mix of normal properties and shorthand in the same obj:
            function makeUser(name, age) {
                return {
                    name,   //same as name: name
                    age: 30
                };
            }

//==========PROPERTY NAMES==========
//==================================
    //object property names can be ANY string* non-string types will be converted to string
        //the restriction on variable names to avoid language reserved words DOES NOT APPLY to property names!
        //*exception is the property named __proto__ which cannot be set to a non-object value

//==========PROPERTY EXISTS TEST==========
//========================================
    //it is possible to access a property that DOES NOT EXIST - it will return "undefined"
    //to test if property exists, use special operator "in"
        //syntax
        "key" in object
        //eg
        let user = { name: "John", age:30 };

        alert( "age" in user );     //returns true, user.age exists
        alert( "blabla" in user );  //returns false, user.blabla doesnt exist
            //NOTE: left side of "in" must be a PROPERTY NAME, usually a quoted string. if no quotes
            //  then it means a variable contains the string to test for
            //eg
            let user = { age: 30, };
            let key = "age";
            alert( key in user ); //true, property "age" exists

    //why use "in" instead of comapring to undefined:
            //because the property could exist, but store the value undefined
            //(even if it *shouldn't* by convention, null should be used for unkown or empty values)

//==========LOOP OVER ALL PROPERTIES OF AN OBJ==========
//======================================================
    //a special form of the for...in loop (different from for(;;) construct)
    //syntax
    for (key in object) {
        //executes body for EACH key amoung the object properties
    }
    //eg. 
    //to output all properties of user:
    let user = { name: "John", age: 30, isAdmin: true, };
    for (let key in user) {
        alert( key ); // keys: name, age, isAdmin
        alert( user[key] ); // values of keys: John, 30, true
    }     alert(userExample["likes birds"]); //getting property; value = true
    delete userExample["likes birds"]; //delete property
        //note that all "for" constructs allow to declare teh looping variable inside the look like let key in eg.
            // for (let prop in obj) is also widely used

        //==========LOOP ORDER==========
        //==============================   
            // Integer properties are sorted numerically (
                    // an integer property is one that can be converted to an integer number 
                    // and back to a string remains the same - so "49" is an integer property 
                    // but "+49" and "1.2" are not)
            //others appear in order created
            //eg
            let codes = {
                "49": "Germany",
                "41": "Switzerland",
                "44": "Great Britain",
                //...,
                "1": "USA",
            };

            for (let code in codes) {
                alert(code); // returns: 1, 41, 44, 49 - ! 
            }

            // to make codes return in order entered must make them non-integer, 
            // so can "cheat" by adding a "+" before ea number is enough.
                //eg
                let codes = {
                    "+49": "Germany",
                    "+41": "Switzerland",
                    "+44": "Great Britain",
                    //...,
                    "+1": "USA",
                };
    
                for (let code in codes) {
                    alert(code); // returns: 49, 41, 44, 1 
                }
