        <h2>Heading 2</h2>

        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading 6</h6>
        <p>Paragraph. This is <strong>bold or strong</strong> text and marks the text as important. You can make text bold without important meaning too--is that the old b tag or something else? Isnt that depreciated?</p>
        <p>New paragraph with <em>italic, or emphasized</em> text. semantically places emphasis so may affect things like screenreaders etc. </p>
        <p> so official diff btwn semantics of strong and em is that strong does NOT change meaning of teh content and convey importance/urgency/seriousness, while em does change meaning, and does not include verbal stress.... </p>
        <p> em and strong tags can be used on their own in place of teh p tags, but its not the most common.</p>
        <p> i is somethimes used to convey mood or voice--used for foreign words or idiomatic phrases, technical terms, ship names, thoughts, etc. b draws attention for utilitarian pourposes withut conveing extra importance, mood, etc. it is the least semantic of the html tags and should only be used when no other tag is mpore appropriate</p>
        <p>"Nesting" elements - placing one inside another, creates a parent-child relationship. The "outermost" tag is the parent, the "innermost" tag is the child. Siblings are elements nested at the same level (in the same parent, preseumably, but not actually explicitely stated in this lesson)</p>
        <p> other elements of note are <mark>mark</mark>, <small>small</small>, <del>del</del>, <ins>ins</ins> (inserted), <sub>sub</sub>, & <sup>sup</sup></p>
        <p> comments arent visible to the browser.... shhhhh <!--I am a comment!-->you can also use Ctrl+/ to convert a line to comment </p>
        <p>Then we have lists
        <ul> 
            <li>wait we close list items now?</li>
            <li>huh, well, i guess its not so bad when the coding program does it for you....</li>
            <li>I did forget how awkward the indenting on these was by default though...</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>1</li>
            <li>2</li>
            <li>list items can be nested in other lists for further indenting!
                <ul><li>like so!</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
