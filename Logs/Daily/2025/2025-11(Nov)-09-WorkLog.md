## Learning
#### TOP - Javascript (0.75 lessons today, at 7.75 of 12 lessons, 1 of 3 projects)
- Loops & Arrays
    - Did Loop reading on the bus, did practice Qs by hand, time to see if they were right!
        - Some misunderstanding towards more complicated answers (thought they wanted lists/arrays, not alerts.)
        - kept forgetting the 'let' in for (*let* i = 0.....)
        - outright derped on what variables are being compared in the nested loops.
        - Because read on the bus, notes on loops are significantly lacking.
    - TOP page questions not done yet, all reading and external practice questions completed
    - submitted GitHub PR on rewording link description as referenced section no longer exists.

## Misc Notes
- made very minor edit to Loops & Arrays lesson (wording) and submitted pull request
    - still kinda anxiety inducing. Surprised.
