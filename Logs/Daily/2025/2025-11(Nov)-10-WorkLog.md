## Learning
#### TOP - Javascript (0.1 lessons today, at 7.85 of 12 lessons, 1 of 3 projects)
- Loops & Arrays (final practice questions)
    - For the Assignment
        - I got the javascript.info questions wrong until copy/sort
            - copy/sort & shuffle had to copy the line, but at least knew I had no clue what the formula was?
            - Filter unique array members I finally got it right on my own. The last of the javascript.info questions
            - [-] do the javascript.info questions again tomorrow ❌ 2025-11-22
        - [-] didn't have it in me to do the TOP exercises. Too worn out from earlier. ❌ 2025-11-22
