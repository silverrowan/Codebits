    - [ ] shoot. forgot to clock in. started approx 5:45, ended 6:15, so approx 30min.
        - [ ] starting to fall asleep :x (did just eat...  )
        - [ ] forgot to clock out when went for a walk (computer was being dumb & needed reboot, so I forgot.) just the usual vexx walk though, so remove ~30 mins as generous.
