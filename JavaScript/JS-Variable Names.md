Variable Declarations - Variable Names-2025-11-04
## Variable Names
can ONLY be of: letters, digits, $ and _ (NOT - !)
first character CANNOT be a digit
cannot be the same as a reserved word eg. let, class, return, function

CASE MATTERS; name is different than NAME
use camelCase as common convention for variables
use ALLCAPS as common convention for constants THAT ARE "hard coded," VALUES KNOWN BEFORE EXECUTION eg. PI, COLOR_RED_HEX
name should have a clean, obvious meaning describing the data it stores.
	make them: human readable (eg userName)
		stay away from abbreviations or short names (unless know what doing) (eg BAD: a, oots)
		maximally descriptive AND concise (eg favoriteColor instead of color)
		consistant - if a visitor is called a 'user' then should name variables like currentUser NOT newVisitor or prevPerson
