## Declaring Strings
Strings must be declared using quotes at beginning and end of String.
	single, double, and backtick are all acceptable quotes.
Back-ticked strings are called **[[JS-Template Literals]]** and have some special properties
## Include quotes in a string
There are a few ways to have a string with quote marks
### different mark
use a different type of quote to enclose the string
eg. `let quote = 'she said "stuff"' //returns she said "stuff"`
### escape 
escape the problem quote marks with \ (mark them as text not code)
eg. `let lyrics = 'I\'ve got no right to take my place...'; // returns I've...`
this technique can be used to insert other special characters as well
## Convert numbers to Strings
like Number() can convert string numbers to number data type
	there is also String() to convert number data type to string type.
