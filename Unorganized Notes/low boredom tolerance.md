with dopamine - its a seesaw. The more highs, the more lows. The balence gets broken w constant stimulation, and can lead to anhedonia (nothing is fun/things are less fun)
- your baseline dopeamine (expectation?) level is too high, so... 
    - hard things seem harder, even impossible.
    - we become more reactive to distractions and impulses (esp when task not as rewarding as the distraction eg. doomscrolling) and always looking for stimulation
- Use a visual timer
    - set 15 min timer, and start doing whatever you are supposed to focus on
    - remove everything other than the task your supposed to do
    - and sometimes dont want to do the thing
    - you cannot do anything else.
    - you have the freedom to do the thing, or to do nothing
- training boredom tolerance, and allows to reset working memory b/c not inputting new info
- if feel not disciplined enough
    - solved w gamifying it
        - if last, got 10pts, and if coiuldnt, -10pts and then give daily score.
        - and try and top scores/compete with others
