## Calculator Project 
- (basic calculations only, 2 numbers, one operator, no order of operations)
    - [x] rough UI design ✅ 2025-11-24
        - [x] physically lay it out on web page ✅ 2025-11-24
    - [x] basic math functions & switcher ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] clear function ✅ 2025-11-25
    - [x] display population ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] divide by 0 error message ✅ 2025-11-27
    - [ ] rounding
- Can it:
    - [x] add ✅ 2025-11-26
    - [x] subtract ✅ 2025-11-26
    - [x] multiply ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] divide ✅ 2025-11-26
    - [x] evaluate properly when format: initial: x + y = ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] evaluate properly when format: initial: x + y + (should calc & ret ans) ✅ 2025-12-01
        - [x] x+y+z should be (x+yANS)+z. It's returning 0+ ✅ 2025-12-01
    - [x] Equation does not update correctly when other operators than '+' used..... after the original one at least. Need to check when that is a problem, exactly. ✅ 2025-12-02
        - [x] format x+y-z reports as => x+y=ans+z : note operator not updated correctly ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] evaluate properly when format: a =/+ ✅ 2025-12-02
        - [x] second num= in a row doesn't update equation, prev number not cleared. ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] evaluate properly when format: =/+ (no variables) ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] evaluate properly when format: a ++ ✅ 2025-12-02
        - [x] second operator should update/change selected operator, but instead clears number & adds 0 ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] evaluate properly when format: + a = b ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] a+b=ANS NUM + => ANS + NUM - wrong! Fixed! now ignores ans & returns NUM + ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] evaluate properly when format: + a + b ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] when = ans KEYPRESS -> does it start a new number properly ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] when +=> ans KEYPRESS -> does it start a new number properly ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] add rounding of answers ✅ 2025-12-04
    - [x] clear removes ALL data ✅ 2025-12-02
    - [x] error when divide by 0 ✅ 2025-12-02
        - returns "impossible, BUT - calc attempts to use it as a value." Should reset to no numbers.
    - [x] assign ANS to value when operator pushed (except \=) ✅ 2025-12-02
- [/] Curr problems
    - [x] screen shifts size based on text ✅ 2025-12-04
    - [ ] discovered javascript rounds negative numbers wrong (for values of 0.5). changing rounding formula to correct this.

- [ ] "extra credit"
    - [x] decimals! - ui element, limit to one decimal per number, adjust rounding ✅ 2025-12-04
        - [ ] decimals have been added. limit to one per number has not yet been completed.
    - [x] backspace ✅ 2025-12-04
        - [x] backspace function is good, toggling listener & style is not yet complete ✅ 2025-12-04
    - [x] keyboard support ✅ 2025-12-04
