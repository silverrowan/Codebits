Floor Sitting

Your ultimate goal should be to work up to sitting on the floor at least thirty cumulative minutes a day, every day. But start where you’re at. If five minutes feels like all you can do, there’s your starting point. Work up to thirty minutes as you’re able. Once you’re there, you can spend all thirty minutes sitting on the floor doing one thing (like reading the newspaper) or break it up. Spend ten minutes sitting on the floor while you work on your laptop (there are plenty of adjustable standing desks, floor desks, and low tables on the market that will allow you to work on the floor), another ten as you talk on the phone, a final ten while you sip a cup of tea. We like to sit on the floor for a half hour while we binge the latest must-see show. We make our kids do it, too.

Finally, don’t feel you have to constrain yourself to crisscross applesauce. While the cross-legged position does a fine job of rotating your hips in ways that sitting in a chair does not, other positions also benefit range of motion and thus mobility. Sitting in a 90/90 position (one leg bent at a 90-degree angle on the floor in front of you, the other leg behind you, also at a 90-degree angle), rotates the hip in two different ways. Sitting with your legs straight in front of you or with one leg straight out in front, the other bent with the foot flat on the floor near your butt, fires up the hamstring, glutes, and calves—muscles that are the movement engines of the body.

Somewhere along the way, people got the notion that you need a sophisticated protocol to feel better in your body and stay vibrant as you age. In fact, it’s quite literally kid stuff—sitting on the floor, just like you did in kindergarten.
