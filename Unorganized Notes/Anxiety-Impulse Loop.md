Cognitive overload 
- most common
    - information overload
    - constant stimulation
    - stress/low sleep/ADHD lowers the threshold
Externalizing every single piece of info you come across
    - eg. daily morning **brain dump** - allows brain "roo mto think" without having to hold all the information
        - jot down everything thinking and have them visualized in gront of you
        - every though/task/responsibility
        - passing thoughs
        - then categorize/group and mark any that are important and need information
            - add important ones to task list
- When start working
    - **impulse log**
        - to not act immediatly on distractions and impulses when you try to focus and...
        - train brain to be aware of the impulse but not respond to them.
        - notepad, etc. keep it next to you when working. when impulse hits, write it down, and keep it to 5 words. whatever the thing that crosses your mind that is not related to work doing.
        - once done work session. go back and review.
            - decide which ones actually still matter. Add those ones to calender/reminder and task list
- also started implementing this during the day, eg when watching/reading something - take notes, on what learn from it etc instead of passively consuming and store it and externalize that information
- meetings - (uses granola- )ai that takes notes on meetings
