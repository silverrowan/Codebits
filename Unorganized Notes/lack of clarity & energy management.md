second major problem
- When we don't know:
    - what to do when
    - how long, and 
    - in which order
- Then we jump between whatever we remember to do
    - see the thing, do the thing
    - remember the thing, do the thing
    - erratic, not predictable - jumping around b/c not dedicated times. & donno when to do them, and everythign feels cluttered and disorganized
        - eg. hyperfocus on useeless shit
- To solve this (suggestion)
    - look into common responcibilities/tasks and noticed certain tasks/categories always need to tackle.
    - for presenter - all tasks fell into 4 categories: urgent, deadline, admin, creative
    - what to do w the categories:
        - essentially created 'sprints' where tackled each group - 1 sprint/1category
            - minimize task switching
    - ok, but we get bored easily...problem 3 [[low boredom tolerance]]
