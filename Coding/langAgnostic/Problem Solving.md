Best way to solve problems involves
1) having a framework
2) practicing it

> *"Problem solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for.... more than progaramming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design. Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than baseline technical skills required for a job."*

To find the right framework article writer used advice in Tim Ferriss' book (on learning), "The 4-hour Chef"

not really a about (just) cooking - its about rapid learning, using cooking to explain "meta-learning" 

What are the steps for learning/problem solving?
1. **Understand**
    1. know exactly what is being asked
    2. most hard problems are only hard because you don't *understand* them
    3. How do you know you understand it?
        1. when you can explain it in plain English
        2. *"if you cant explain something in simple terms you dont understand it"* - Richard Feynman
    4. This is why explaining a problem to someone
        1. or writing it down
        2. or doodling a diagram
        3. or telling someone else about it (or a duck)
2. a.  Brainstorm is needed. (from mit video)
3. Plan
    1. DONT dive right into solving it without a plan! Plan your solution!
    2. Nothing can help you if you don't write down the exact steps.
    3. In programming this means don't start coding right away. Take time to analyze and process the information.
    4. To get a good plan, answer this question:
        1. Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y ?
            1. Comments are a great tool for this!
4. Divide
    1. the most important step of them all
    2. Do NOT try to solve one big problem
    3. Break it into smaller sub-problems (much easier to solve)
    4. Then solve the sub-problems, one at a time, simplest first
        1. simplest means you know the answer
        2. after that, simplest means that it doesn't rely on other problems being solved.
        3. once all sub-problems are solved, connect the dots.
    5. This technique is the corner stone of problem solving!
5. Stuck?
    -  Keep your cool. Best programmers/problem solvers are more curious about problems/bugs than irritated.
    -  Debug!
        - go through your solutions step by step to find where you went wrong.
            - what you actually told the computer to do vs what you meant to tell it to do.
    - Reassess
        - take a step back, and look at the prob from another perspective
        - is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach
        - another way of doing this is just starting over from scratch
    - Research
        - Google!
        - Look for solutions to *sub-problems* not the big problem
- Practice
    - if you want to be a good problem solver, solve a lot of problems!
