## Tests Driven Development (TDD)
- the practice of writing automated tests that describe how your code should work before you actually write the code.
    - eg. if you want to write a function that adds a couple numbers, you would first write a test that uses the function and supplies the expected output.
    - The test will fail before you write your code, and you should be able to know that your code works correctly when it passes.
    - In many ways it is more productive with TDD than without.
        - without the testing code, you have to manyally plug in vales and make sure its working - not a big problem for simple cases, but once things get even as complicated as tic tac toe manually checking all flow work gets onerous.
- actually writing the tests is a #later-lesson
