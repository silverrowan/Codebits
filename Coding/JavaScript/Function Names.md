- Functions are actions, so their name is usually a verb.
    - it should be brief, as accurate as possible, and describe what the function does.
        - function name should effectively be a comment! 'self-describing'
    - wide practice to start a function with a verbal pre-fix that vaguely describes the action.
        - there needs to be agreement on the meaning of these prefixes w/in a team
        - examples: get... show... calc... create... check... etc.
- A function should do EXACTLY what its name suggests, and NO MORE.
    - (and remember that a function should only do one thing...)
