## Variable Declarations
- ~~var - old, depreciated. may see in old codes, has some quirks~~
- const - constants; variables that cannot be changed once set
- let - standard variable - can re-assign value
````js
let a = 3; // make variable a, give it value 3`
a = 5; //change variable a's value to 5`
OR
let message = 'Hello!'; //define variable & assign value in one. can be split into let message; message = 'hello'
````
