A #value is a piece of information or #data that can be stored, manipulated, and processed within a program. 
- `eg. let variableName = "value"`
- values can be of any #data-type. (THIS is what makes it not language agnostic--in some langs the variable holds the data-type)
    - the value *is* the #data, while the [[JS-Data Types |data type]] is *how* its held in memory.
