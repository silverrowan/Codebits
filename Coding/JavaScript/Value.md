A #value is a piece of information or data that can be stored, manipulated, and processed within a program. 
- `eg. let variableName = "value"`
- Values *always* include the [[Data Types|data type]]. %% - (THIS is what makes it not language agnostic--in some langs the variable holds the data-type) %%
- Values can be of any data type. 
    - the value *is* the data, while the [[Data Types|data type]] is *how* its held in memory.
