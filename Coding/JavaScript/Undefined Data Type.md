## Undefined
- Undefined is the only value of the undefined type.
- The meaning of undefined is "value not assigned"
    - the variable was declared, but not given/assigned a value.
- *technically* it is possible to explicitly assign `undefined` to a variable
    - but this is ***not recommended***, and instead [[Null Data Type|null]] should be used to *assign* an empty or unknown value, while undefined is reserved as *default initial value for unassigned* things
