This repository is for assorted notes that don't
belong in any one repository.

It contains:
    my work log (workLog.txt), 
    bits of code (codeBit folder) that I expect to 
        need refreshing on occassionally/to use, and
    notes (notesSyntaxEtc Folder) being made & 
        organized going through The Odin Project (to 
        help me learn, not really for normal reference, 
        but perhaps later they'll be refined for that).

Sorting numbers in JS being one such codebit example, and
the first being uploaded.
