                Tim's Funeral - Oct 30. Day spent w Maddy & Family at wake-ish-thing
            Health & Lifestyle (LOTS of info from Maddy)
                Discussion w Maddy
                    - good odds low on electrolites (something to do with EDS)
                        may be causing the migranes, tiredness, etc
                        definately helped the one migrane
                    - the shoulder thing is abs a sublexion. The knee thing is prob not.
                    - she thinks the pinky and elbow tests are pos for me.
                    - skin *is* stretchyer than normal
                    - she thinks I may have low grade allergies
                        contributing to the migranes & bloody nose & fatigue
                        test by tracking w and wout antihistamine in morning (1 costco pill)
                    - overdoing it re exercise 'measured' by still being fatigued by the thing for ~24+ hrs
                    - possible the sugar-migrane thing is a paradoxal response to sugar
                        LOW sugar can cause migranes. Maddy exhibited low suger in response to 
                        diabetic test & sugary breakfast
