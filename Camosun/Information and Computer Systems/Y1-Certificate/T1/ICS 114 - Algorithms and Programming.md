### Learning Outcomes & Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:
- Solve abstract problems using software design methodology;
- Design an algorithm to solve a problem using problem decomposition and step-wise refinement;
- Trace the execution of object-oriented code to validate its correctness;
- Apply and explain object-oriented techniques including the creation of objects, application of inheritance, information hiding, encapsulation, scope and pass-by-value and pass-by-reference;
- Design, implement, test and debug simple programs in an object-orientated language using appropriate arithmetic and logical operations, conditions and iterative control structures, and data types;
- Apply problem-solving skills and provide a foundation for advanced programming courses;
- Use written, oral, and electronic communication to convey technical information effectively; and
- Apply accepted standards to ensure security, privacy, and integrity of data while recognizing the ethical, legal and social implications of computing
