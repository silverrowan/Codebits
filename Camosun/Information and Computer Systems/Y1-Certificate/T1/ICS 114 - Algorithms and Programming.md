# ICS 114 - Algorithms and Programming
Credits: 3 Total Hours: 75 Restricted to students in Information and Computer Systems and Interactive Media Developer programs
Learn how to design and implement algorithms to solve problems using object-oriented programming. You will start to practice the foundational skills, tools and methods to produce and maintain quality software systems. 

### TOPICS (Fall 2023; Lynda E. Robbins,)
COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES / OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:
• Solve abstract problems using software design methodology;
• Design an algorithm to solve a problem using problem decomposition and step-wise refinement;
• Trace the execution of object-oriented code to validate its correctness;
• Apply and explain object-oriented techniques including the creation of objects, application of inheritance,
information hiding, encapsulation, scope and pass-by-value and pass-by-reference;
• Design, implement, test and debug simple programs in an object-orientated language using appropriate
arithmetic and logical operations, conditions and iterative control structures, and data types;
• Apply problem-solving skills and provide a foundation for advanced programming courses;
• Use written, oral, and electronic communication to convey technical information effectively; and
• Apply accepted standards to ensure security, privacy, and integrity of data while recognizing the ethical, legal
and social implications of computing
