CALENDAR DESCRIPTION
Students will learn mathematical and statistical concepts relevant to introductory computer programming for development of programming and data interpretation skills. Students will study binary numbers, logic, Boolean algebra, sequences and series, and asymptotic (Big-O) notation, counting techniques, introductory probability, descriptive statistics, and confidence intervals.
### Learning Outcomes & Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course a student will be able to:
1. Show fluency with the numbering systems commonly used in computer science
    1. Count using binary, octal, and hexadecimal bases.
    2. Convert decimal numbers to and from binary, octal, and hexadecimal bases.
    3. Convert real numbers between binary, octal, and hexadecimal bases.
2. Use correct terminology, notation, and symbolic processes in logic and Boolean algebra to facilitate proper programming skills and logical thinking
    1. a. Use truth tables to define the logical connectives "and", "or", and "not".
    2. b. Complete truth tables and use the laws of logic to simplify logical and Boolean expressions and prove equivalence.
    3. c. Use the conditional and related logical forms to translate English expressions into logical symbols and analyze conditional and biconditional propositions.
3. Use sequences and series to solve applied problems used in programming
    1. Solve problems involving general and recursive forms for sequences, including the arithmetic and geometric cases.
    2. b. Evaluate sums for arithmetic and geometric series.
4. Use asymptotic (Big-O) notation to describe the response of various types of computer algorithms to changes in input size
    1. a. Sketch graphs of linear, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic functions.
    2. b. Rank computer algorithms for efficiency based on their Big-O complexity.
5. Use probability theory to solve applied problems
    1. a. Use counting techniques to solve applied problems.
    2. b. Calculate probabilities using simple events, counting techniques, and the properties of probability. 
    3. c. Perform calculations involving the Normal distribution.
6. Organize, summarize, display, and interpret data in a meaningful way using descriptive statistical techniques 
    1. a. Describe a data set numerically by way of the mean, median, and standard deviation. 
    2. b. Interpret histograms and other graphical displays of data sets. 
    3. c. Make predictions about the distribution of a data set using the Empirical Rule and Tchebyshev's Theorem.
7. Use inferential statistical techniques to make predictions about populations
    1. a. Discuss issues associated with collecting and interpreting data from sample surveys.
    2. b. For large samples, calculate and interpret confidence intervals for population means.
    3. c. Determine appropriate sample sizes.
8. Identify and articulate issues regarding the use and misuse of statistics in society, to gain an awareness of proper uses of statistics in the workplace
