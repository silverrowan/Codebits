### Learning Outcomes & Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:
- Design, implement, test and debug object-oriented solutions for small systems involving multiple objects;
- including programming techniques of inheritance, abstraction, modularization,
information hiding, overloading, interfaces
- Identify appropriate abstract data types and data structures based on the characteristics of the application; 
- including use of software libraries
- Implement and evaluate the trade-offs between a static and a dynamic implementation of an abstract data type using Big-O notation;
