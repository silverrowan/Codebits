### Learning Outcomes & Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course a student will be able to:
- Explain the practices that are key components of various process models for software development such as waterfall, agile, scrum, and spiral;
- Use software development tools to troubleshoot and debug the programming code in an application;
- Apply the basic principles of software project management in a team environment;
- Compare a variety of strategies to test simple programs including white-box test, black-box test, top-down and bottom-up tests;
- Identify methods that will lead to the creation of reusable software components and templates;
- Use software design patterns to help build and maintain a working 3-tier software application;
- Apply software development scripting tools to build and manage application development cycles using a version control framework;
- Think critically to evaluate information, solving problems, and making decisions as they relate to the use of software tools for software development;
- Apply accepted standards to ensure security, privacy, and integrity of software while recognizing the ethical, legal, and social implications of software development.
