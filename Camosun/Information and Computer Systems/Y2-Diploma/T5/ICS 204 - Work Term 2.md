# ICS 204 - Work Term 2

Credits: 6 Total Hours: 420 Restricted to Co-op/Internship students in Information and Computer Systems
This work term builds upon the foundational experience of the first work term course and provides the opportunity for students to explore pathways and take on new responsibilities. Students will engage in tasks and projects that allow them to develop and strengthen their discipline-specific knowledge and skills and make positive contributions to the workplace. Demonstrating professionalism appropriate to the discipline and industry/field, students will navigate work environments effectively. They will develop the confidence and initiative to make informed decisions and direct their own learning. Students will integrate academic knowledge with practical experience through thoughtful reflection. 

A site visit is an integral component of the course, involving the student, Workplace Supervisor, and Co-op Field Instructor. Students are supported in the work term by the Co-op Field Instructor who mentors and acts as a bridge between the academic and work realms. The Workplace Supervisor and the Co-op Field Instructor work in partnership to assess student work performance and/or assignments.

Prerequisites
All of:

    COM in ICS 104 
    Cumulative GPA of at least 3.0
