In this advanced work term, students will further develop their professionalism and career agency as they take on roles and responsibilities in the workplace. They will engage in projects and tasks that further develop their discipline-specific and professional skills. Using their initiative, they will make positive contributions to the workplace. Students will synthesize their experiences and reflections and align their career path with their values and aspirations.  

A site visit is an integral component of the course, involving the student, Workplace Supervisor, and Co-op Field Instructor. Students are supported in the work term by the Co-op Field Instructor who mentors and acts as a bridge between the academic and work realms. The Workplace Supervisor and the Co-op Field Instructor work in partnership to assess student work performance and/or assignments.
